# Practice: Encapsulation 1

Complete the code to create a `BankAccount` class with:
- A private `#balance` field (use `#` for private fields in JS).
- A `deposit(amount)` method to add to the balance.
- A `getBalance()` method to return the current balance.

Test your class by depositing money and checking the balance.

**Focus only on private fields and encapsulation.**
