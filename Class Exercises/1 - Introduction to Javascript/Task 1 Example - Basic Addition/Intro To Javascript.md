__Introduction__ 

Here is an example of a webpage that uses html, javascript and css combined.

In class we are mostly interested in teaching you Javascript initially so for most projects you will be provided with a template and you will just need to complete the javascript for that project.

If you want to alter and play with the CSS then you are wlecome to but that will not be our focus while we learn Javascript.

__Your Tasks__

Each topic is divided into multiple tasks.
For each task you are provided with and example piece of starter code for your reference and then template code for each of the exercises for you to complete.

For example our fust task in this introduction topic is Task 1. You will see there is a Task 1 Example folder then 4 additional Task 1 'task' folders for you to complete.

Please make sure you complete your tasks in these folders only. This will allow you to keep your work organised and also allow your teacher to track your progress more easily.

Try to complete Task 1a through to 1d!
