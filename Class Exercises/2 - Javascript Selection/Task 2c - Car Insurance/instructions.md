Write a program to calculate car insurance premiums based on the following criteria:

1. Base premium is £500
2. Age adjustments:
   - Under 25: Add 50% to base premium
   - 25-40: No change to base premium
   - Over 40: Subtract 15% from base premium

3. No Claims Bonus adjustments:
   - 0 years: No discount
   - 1-2 years: 10% discount
   - 3-5 years: 25% discount
   - Over 5 years: 35% discount

4. Previous Claims:
   - Each previous claim adds 20% to the final premium
-
The program should collect the driver's age, years of no claims bonus, and number of previous claims, then calculate and display the final premium.
