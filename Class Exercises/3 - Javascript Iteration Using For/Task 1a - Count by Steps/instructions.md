# Task 1a - Count by Steps

Create a program that lets the user count up using different step sizes. The program should:

1. Allow the user to input:
   - Start number
   - End number
   - Step size

2. Display the sequence of numbers from start to end, counting by the step size

Example:
- Start: 2
- End: 10
- Step: 2
Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

Learning objectives:
- Using the step value in a for loop
- Input validation
- Sequence generation
