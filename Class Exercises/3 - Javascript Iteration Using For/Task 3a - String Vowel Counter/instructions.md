# Task 3a - Count the Vowels!

Type a word or sentence and click the button. The program will count how many vowels (A, E, I, O, U) are in your text and show you which ones it found.

- Try different words and sentences!
- What happens if you use no vowels?
- Can you find a word with all the vowels?

This exercise helps you practice looping through a string and using simple conditions.
