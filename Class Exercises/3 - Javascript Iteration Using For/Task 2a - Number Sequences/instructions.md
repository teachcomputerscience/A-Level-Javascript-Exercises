# Exercise

Create a program that generates number sequences based on different loop patterns:

1. Count from 1 to N
2. Count backwards from N to 1
3. Count in steps (e.g., every 2nd number)
4. Generate even numbers up to N
5. Generate odd numbers up to N

The program should:
1. Allow the user to enter a maximum number (N)
2. Allow selection of sequence type
3. Display the generated sequence
4. Show the number of items in the sequence
5. Calculate the sum of all numbers in the sequence

This exercise introduces:
- Basic for loop structure
- Loop counting up and down
- Using step values in loops
- Loop with conditions
