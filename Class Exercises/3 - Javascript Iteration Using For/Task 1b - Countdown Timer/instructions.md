# Task 1b - Countdown Timer

Create a program that simulates a countdown timer. The program should:

1. Allow the user to input:
   - Start number (where to count down from)
   - Time delay between numbers (in milliseconds)

2. Display a countdown that:
   - Starts from the given number
   - Counts down to zero
   - Shows each number with the specified delay

Example:
- Start: 5
- Delay: 1000ms (1 second)
Output: 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... 0... Blast off!

Learning objectives:
- Counting backwards with a for loop
- Using setTimeout for timing
- Descending sequences
