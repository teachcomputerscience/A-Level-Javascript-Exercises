# Task 3b - Array Fun!

Try the buttons to:
- Add up all the numbers in an array
- List all the food emojis in an array
- Find the pizza emoji in the array (and its position)

Can you change the code to use your own numbers or foods?

This exercise helps you practice looping through arrays and using conditions.
