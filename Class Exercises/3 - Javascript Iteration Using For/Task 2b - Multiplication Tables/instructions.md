# Exercise

Create a program that generates a multiplication table using nested for loops. The program should:

1. Allow the user to specify:
   - Starting number (e.g., 1)
   - Ending number (e.g., 12)
   - Number of tables to generate (e.g., 1-5)

2. Generate tables that show:
   - Multiplication facts in order
   - Each table in a separate column
   - Clear formatting for readability

3. Features:
   - Highlight even products in a different color
   - Show row and column headers
   - Display total number of calculations performed

This exercise introduces:
- Nested for loops
- Table generation
- Loop counters
- Formatting output
- Multiple loop conditions
