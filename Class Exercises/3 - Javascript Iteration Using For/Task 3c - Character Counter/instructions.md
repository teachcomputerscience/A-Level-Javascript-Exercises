# Task 3c - Character Counter

Type a word or sentence and click the button. The program will count how many times each character appears in your text.

- Try it with your name, a sentence, or a silly word!
- What happens with spaces or punctuation?

This exercise helps you practice looping through a string and using an object to count things.
