This example demonstrates several simple uses of for loops in JavaScript. Each button runs a different loop-based task, such as:

- Displaying a multiplication table (e.g., 3 times table)
- Summing numbers from 1 to 10
- Displaying the alphabet (A-Z)
- Calculating the average of five random numbers
- Displaying 20 random numbers
- Showing ASCII codes for letters A-L

Each task uses a basic for loop to process numbers or characters, and the results are shown in the output area. These examples are designed to help you understand how for loops work with numbers, strings, and arrays.
